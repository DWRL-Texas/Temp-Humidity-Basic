# Temperature and Humidity Basic Sensor
This tutorial shows how to set up a basic temperature and humidity sensor using Arduino Uno

## Parts:
- DHT11 sensor
- Arduino Uno + USB Cable
- 10k resistor
- Jumper wires

## Download and Install:
- Download and install the **Temp-Humidity-Basic zip file** by clicking the green Clone or Download button above and selecting *Download ZIP*
- Unzip this file; all the files you'll need will be contained inside
- Unzip the **DHTLib.zip** file, and drag the subsequent DHTLib **FOLDER** to the Documents/Arduino/libraries folder. This will install the necessary library in the Arduino IDE

## Create Arduino Circuit:
- Open the **DHT_basic_bb.pdf**  
 
 
 ## IDE Code:
 - Double click the **DHT_basic.ino** file from your download and say Yes to the Arduino IDE pop-up window.
 - The file should open directly in your Arduino IDE application
 - Click the *Compile* button to be sure the code has no bugs, then plug in your Arduino circuit and *Upload* the code

### Ranges and Accuracy of the DHT11:

- Humidity Range: 20-90% RH
- Humidity Accuracy: ±5% RH
- Temperature Range: 0-50 °C
- Temperature Accuracy: ±2% °C
- Operating Voltage: 3V to 5.5V
